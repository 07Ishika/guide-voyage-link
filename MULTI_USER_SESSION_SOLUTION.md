# 🔧 Multi-User Session Issue - SOLUTION

## ❌ **Root Cause Identified**

The issue you're experiencing is **normal browser behavior**:

### **How Browser Sessions Work:**
```
Browser Tab 1: Login as Migrant → Session Cookie = Migrant
Browser Tab 2: Login as Guide → Session Cookie = Guide (OVERWRITES)
Browser Tab 1: Now shows Guide (because same cookie!)
```

**All tabs in the same browser share the same session cookie.** This is by design for security and consistency.

## ✅ **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. User Switcher Component**
- Added a **User Switcher** in top-left corner
- Shows current user and role
- Quick switch between any user
- Logout functionality

### **2. Multiple Testing Methods**

#### **Method A: Different Browsers**
```
Chrome: Login as Migrant
Firefox: Login as Guide
Edge: Login as another user
```

#### **Method B: Incognito Windows**
```
Chrome Normal: Login as Migrant
Chrome Incognito: Login as Guide
```

#### **Method C: User Switcher (Same Browser)**
```
1. Login as Migrant
2. Click "Switch" in top-left
3. Select Guide user
4. All tabs switch to Guide
```

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### **Test 1: Single User Consistency**
1. Login as migrant
2. Open multiple tabs
3. All tabs should show migrant role
4. Navigate around - role stays consistent ✅

### **Test 2: User Switching**
1. Login as migrant
2. Use User Switcher to switch to guide
3. All tabs should switch to guide role ✅

### **Test 3: Multi-Browser Testing**

- Role stays consistent across tabs

### **Different Browsers:**
- Each browser can have different user
- Chrome: Migrant, Firefox: Guide
- Sessions are completely separate

## 🛠️ **How to Use**

### **For Development/Testing:**
1. **Single Role Testing**: Use one browser, switch users as needed
2. **Multi-Role Testing**: Use different browsers or incognito
3. **Quick Switching**: Use the User Switcher component

### **For Production:**
- Users will typically use one role per browser
- User Switcher can be hidden in production
- Normal login/logout flow

## 🚀 **Final Result**
