# Role-Based Access Control Test

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:

### 🧑‍💼 **As Sarah Chen (Migrant):**
1. Login → Should redirect to `/guides` 
2. Header should show: "Community", "Find Guides", "Costlytic"
3. **Cannot access** `/dashboard-guide` → Should show "Access Denied"
4. Can browse guides and make call requests TO Michael

### 👨‍⚕️ **As Dr. Michael Rodriguez (Guide):**
1. Login → Should redirect to `/home/guide`
2. Header should show: "Dashboard", "Community", "Find Migrants"  
3. **Can access** `/dashboard-guide` → Should show his session requests
4. Can see and accept/decline requests FROM migrants

### 👩‍💻 **As Ishika Sharma (Migrant):**
1. Login → Should redirect to `/guides`
2. Header should show: "Community", "Find Guides", "Costlytic"
3. **Cannot access** `/dashboard-guide` → Should show "Access Denied"
4. Can browse guides and make call requests TO Michael

## Test Steps:

### Step 1: Test Sarah (Migrant)
1. Go to `/manual-login`
2. Login as "Sarah Chen"
3. Should redirect to `/guides` ✅
4. Check header navigation - should show migrant options ✅
5. Try to go to `/dashboard-guide` - should show "Access Denied" ✅

### Step 2: Test Michael (Guide)  
1. Go to `/manual-login`
2. Login as "Dr. Michael Rodriguez"
3. Should redirect to `/home/guide` ✅
4. Check header navigation - should show guide options ✅
5. Go to `/dashboard-guide` - should work properly ✅

### Step 3: Test Call Request Flow
1. Login as Sarah → Go to `/guides` → Find Michael → "Book Call" → Submit
2. Login as Michael → Go to `/dashboard-guide` → Should see Sarah's request ✅

## Fixed Issues:

✅ **Header Role Detection**: Now uses actual user role from authentication, not route-based detection

✅ **Dashboard Access Control**: Only guides can access `/dashboard-guide`

✅ **Proper Redirects**: 
- Migrants → `/guides`
- Guides → `/home/guide`

✅ **Role-Based Navigation**: Different header menus for guides vs migrants

## If Issues Persist:

Check browser console for:
- Authentication errors
- User role data
- API call failures

The system should now properly enforce role-based access control!
