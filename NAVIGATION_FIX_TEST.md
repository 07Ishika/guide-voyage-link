# 🔧 Navigation Fix Test

## ❌ **Previous Issue**
After login, users were experiencing role switching/navigation issues:
- Multiple redirections happening
- Users getting bounced between pages
- Roles appearing to switch after login

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **RoleSelect.jsx**
- Added `hasNavigated` state to prevent multiple redirections
- Only redirect if on `/role` page AND haven't navigated yet
- Use `replace: true` to prevent back button issues
- Prevent navigation loops

### 2. **Index.jsx** 
- Only redirect guides if specifically on `/home` page
- Don't redirect if already on correct page
- Use `replace: true` for cleaner navigation

### 3. **Navigation Logic**
```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentUser && currentUser.role) {
    navigate('/some-page'); // Runs on every render!
  }
}, [currentUser, navigate]);

// NEW (fixed):
useEffect(() => {
  if (currentUser && currentUser.role && 
      window.location.pathname === '/specific-page' && 
      !hasNavigated) {
    setHasNavigated(true);
    navigate('/target-page', { replace: true });
  }
}, [currentUser, navigate, hasNavigated]);
```

## 🧪 **Test Steps**

### **Test 1: Migrant Login**
1. Go to `/role`
2. Select "Migrant" and login
3. Should go to `/home` and STAY there
4. Check debug panel: `Is Migrant: ✅`
5. Navigate around - should not switch roles

### **Test 2: Guide Login**
1. Go to `/role`
2. Select "Guide" and login  
3. Should go to `/home/guide` and STAY there
4. Check debug panel: `Is Guide: ✅`
5. Navigate around - should not switch roles

### **Test 3: No Role Switching**
1. Login as migrant
2. Navigate to different pages
3. Role should remain "migrant" throughout
4. Navbar should stay consistent for migrants

## 🔍 **Debug Panel Check**
The debug panel should show stable values:
```
🔍 Auth Debug
Loading: ❌
Authenticated: ✅
Is Guide: ❌  (or ✅ for guides)
Is Migrant: ✅  (or ❌ for guides)
User Role: migrant  (should NOT change)
User Name: John Doe  (should NOT change)
```

## 🚀 **Expected Behavior**
- **One-time navigation** after role selection
- **Stable role** throughout session
- **No role switching** after login
- **Consistent navbar** based on role
- **No navigation loops**

The navigation should now be stable and users should stay in their selected role! 🎯
