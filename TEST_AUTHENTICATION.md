# Authentication Flow Test

## Fixed Issues:

### ✅ **Issue 1: Correct Redirects - MIGRANTS GO TO /HOME FIRST**
- **Migrants** now redirect to `/home` (their personalized dashboard)
- **Guides** redirect to `/home/guide` (their dashboard)

### ✅ **Issue 2: Double Login Fixed**
- AuthContext now updates immediately after manual login
- Added `setUser` method to update context without refetching
- Added small delay to ensure context update before redirect

### ✅ **Issue 3: Migrant Home Page Created**
- `/home` now shows a personalized dashboard for migrants
- Quick access cards to Find Guides, Costlytic, Community, Profile
- Getting started guide for new users
- No more automatic redirects - migrants stay on `/home`
